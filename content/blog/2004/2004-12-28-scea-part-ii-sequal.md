Been doing UML diagrams (class and sequence diagram mainly) all day. Fjew, although reverse engineering of existing code
shouldn't be too difficult I spend quite some time in looking why I did what. Now the only thing that I still need to do
is create a component diagram and do the whole documentation part around it. Found out that [Jude (a free UML tool)](https://www.esm.jp/jude-web/en/index.html) that
is written completely in java released a new version.
