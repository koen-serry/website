Been chasing my tail here for half an hour. Got a 404 when trying to format an EDI message through my EdiFormatter
application which helps me reading those formats. No matter what I did it gave me a 404 till I tried it locally and saw
it couldn't find the class. 

Ahhrrrr.....changed package but forgot to update the web.xml. Ok well, if you've searched
long enough for a stupid problem then you'll figure them out easier and faster next time you'll encounter them.
