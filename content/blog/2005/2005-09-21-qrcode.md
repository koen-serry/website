Finally something really innovative in the world of cellphones. Like an FM-tuner or an mp3 player didn't make sense to me 
besides the generation of traffic for youngsters. That was until now. If combined with
something called QRCode which is a 2D barcode easely recognised by software (don't know yet how easy) it could allow
people to have an easy lookup information on the net.

The people at [semapedia.org](semapedia.org) allow people to generate such a QRCode with the url to whatever (they take wikipedia, but
it's non specific) that they can print out and put it onto/next to an item. This way if you encounter something which
you don't know what it is (but like to find out), just scan it with your cellphone and see what page it brings you.

I'm pretty sure those spam-criminals will find some use in this pretty soon...
