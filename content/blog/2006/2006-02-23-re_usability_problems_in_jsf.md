A while back I've posted a <a href="http://www.serry.org/2005/01/04/1104864885417.html">comparison on JSF vs Tapestry</a>
and even though it was a while back (last year). The points are still valid.

If you have something to add, see <a href="http://sfjsf.blogspot.com/2006/02/usability-problems-in-jsf.html">here</a>
another person with some issues with JSF.
