Fjew, finally done. Just installed the new server and I have to say it, it's a lean mean killing machine :)
The webapp is completely build via webwork 2 and I have to say it, it really rocks. Validation, I18n and that combined with
the radeox engine (which needed some modifications that I'll need to post back to the authors still)
