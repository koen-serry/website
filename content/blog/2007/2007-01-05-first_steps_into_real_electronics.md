Ok, we've had electronics classes when I was studying. 
But nothing like when you're messing around with it yourself. 
So this year my promise was to get into the electronics/microprocessing thing. I bought a PICDEM2+ board to try things out.
And today they arrived YAHOO....

The Board is working, the ICD2 is working, now why can't they see one another. 

`read 0x0` what is this?
