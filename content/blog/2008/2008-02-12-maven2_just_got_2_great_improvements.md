Maven2 recently got 2 big improvements. `mvn archetype:create` allows you to create a new
project from scratch and start with an existing project infrastructure that you can easily adapt. 
Previously you had to pass options in via the infamous -D parameter, now it guides you through some kind of wizard.

The other enhancement I just read on Brett Porters website where you will in a future release be able to condense your
xml in the pom to attributes (<a href="http://blogs.exist.com/bporter/2008/02/11/maven-now-supports-condensed-poms-using-attributes/">more info</a>)

Finally you'll be able to see all your dependencies without having to scroll for ages :)
