You certainly know the problem: you have literally hundreds of websites asking you to invent a username and a password,
which you'll have to remember potentially weeks or even months later. 

Well there's a solution:

OpenId works as follows : 

1. You log into a website with your openid "URL" : Mine for example is  http://kserry.blogspot.com/
2. The webpage you want to login to is redirecting you to your provider.
3. On the providers' website you login with your credentials (this is the only you'll have to remember)
4. The providers' website redirects to back to your original website and you'll either be presented with a form (without the fields you
allowed your openid provider to see to external parties and without the username/password)
